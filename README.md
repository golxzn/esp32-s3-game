### `[Road To Embedded]`

## About

This project was essentially created for a single purpose: I wanted to find
a job and got relocated to New Zealand. Since C++ is used more in embedded
there, I decided to make such a project, which will be both interesting for
me as a game (+engine) developer and them as a hiring companies.

> Spoiler: nobody cares. I had probably solve 1000+ leetcode or something.

Anyway, here we are! For videos and other interesting stuff, dive in my
[telegram channel](https://t.me/golxzn_channel). I shared there A LOT of
fun stuff like SIMD on this chip!

* Double-Buffered Rendering using TFT 3'5 ili9486 through [Dedicated GPIO][dedic-gpio] (I'm planning to migrate to Octal-SPI to reach 60 FPS);
* [SPIFF][spiff] file system;
* Multiple simultaneous [WAV file][wav-file] support using [LEDC][ledc] and [PWM][pwm].
* [DualSenseÂ®][dualsense] controller support over [HID over USB][hid-over-usb] (I did BT Classic, but then realize that esp32-s3 doesn't support it ðŸ˜­);
